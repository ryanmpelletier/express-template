# express-template
# Template Express Application using Gulp, Babel, and Webpack

*This assumes an elementary knowledge of node.js and how npm works with the package.json file* (basically what the "dependencies" are and how the "scripts" are called when the npm command is run in the same directory). It also assumes that node, npm, and git are installed.

For anybody who wants a basic express application template, here you go. The build files used are pretty simple, and are also documented well. In order to run the project follow the steps below. *First make sure node and npm are installed and up to date*


1.  **mkdir** express-template
1.  **cd** express-template
1.  **git** clone https://github.com/ryanp102694/express-template.git
1.  **npm install**
1.  **npm start**
1.  *Browse to localhost:8080*
